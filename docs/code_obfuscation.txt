1. For code obfuscation we use, in our app level build.gradle file:
		android {
    			buildTypes {
        			release {
            				// Enables code shrinking, obfuscation, and optimization for only
            				// your project's release build type.
            				minifyEnabled true

            				// Enables resource shrinking, which is performed by the
            				// Android Gradle plugin.
            				shrinkResources true

            				...
        			}
   		 	}
    			...
		}
