1. Create a class extending "Worker" that would do the required background operation.
   This class requires you to create a constructor that matches its super class. It 
   takes two arguments as an input (namely: context and workerParams). We don't need
   to implement this constructor so we don't have learn about them now.

   This class also requires you to override "doWork()" method. The logic of your work
   goes in this method. For example: you may want to sync users data with your server
   here.

2. Now in the MainActivity we need to create a "PeriodicWorkRequest" then using 
   "WorkManager" we need to call "enqueueUniquePeriodicWork()" static method on the 
   instance of this work manager.
